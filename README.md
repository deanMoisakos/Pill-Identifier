# Pill-Identifier
Pill Identifier using OpenCV and PyTorch
Intended for capstone project. First step is to get the machine to actually identify a pill is
Then I want it to be able to identify individual pills, this will probably be done by attaching names to each image file
Then when thats done, the hope is that the program will identify the pill and be able to give facts on it like safe dosage, name, purpose, etc
